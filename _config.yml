#        title: Fullstack Development
#        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
#          I taught myself TypeScript/JavaScript in early 2021.
#          Since then I have built several prototypes of full-stack applications.
#          My current default tech stack includes the Angular and Nest.js frameworks, MySQL, Docker, GitHub and AWS (EC2, RDS, Amplify, Lightsail).
#          Take a look at my showcase [server-to-server chat application](https://github.com/estrehle/webchat) to see how I code.

#        title: Decentralized Data Exchanges
#        description: |
#          Much of my recent work has revolved around decentralized data exchanges.
#          These are computer networks where data is stored and controlled by its owners instead of a central agent.
#          My personal focus within this area has been on the (in-)applicability of blockchain technology and [self-sovereign identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity) frameworks.
#          Some of my outputs are publicly available, including a [blog post](https://www.blockchainresearchlab.org/2020/12/11/enterprise-dlt-the-leaky-trust-machine-2/) on blockchain's confidentiality issues
#          and a [working paper](https://www.blockchainresearchlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BRL-Working-Paper-No-18-DibiChain.pdf) sketching a privacy-preserving decentralized data exchange.
#
#          Currently I am part of the [BloGÂ³ research project](https://www.blog3.de/) (link in German) which aims to give patients autonomy over their medical data.
#          My contribution to the project includes co-architecting and co-implementing a decentralized data exchange built on top of the [Hyperledger Aries](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries) toolkit.
#          Unfortunately, the results are not (yet) public.

#        title: Data Engineering and Machine Learning
#        description: |
#          I have experience in various stages of the data processing life cycle, including automated data import from REST APIs,
#          data modeling and transformation in TypeScript and Python,
#          interaction with relational databases through ORMs and SQL
#          as well as basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning.
#          For a developer, my aversion to Microsoft Office is unusually low, and I enjoy explaining and presenting data to all kinds of audiences.
