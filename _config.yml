        title: Fullstack Development
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I taught myself TypeScript/JavaScript in early 2021.
          Since then I have built several prototypes of full-stack applications.
          My current default tech stack includes the Angular and Nest.js frameworks, MySQL, Docker, GitHub and AWS (EC2, RDS, Amplify, Lightsail).
          Take a look at my showcase [server-to-server chat application](https://github.com/estrehle/webchat) to see how I code.

        title: Decentralized Data Exchanges
        description: |
          Much of my recent work has revolved around decentralized data exchanges.
          These are computer networks where data is stored and controlled by its owners instead of a central agent.
          My personal focus within this area has been on the (in-)applicability of blockchain technology and [self-sovereign identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity) frameworks.
          Some of my outputs are publicly available, including a [blog post](https://www.blockchainresearchlab.org/2020/12/11/enterprise-dlt-the-leaky-trust-machine-2/) on blockchain's confidentiality issues
          and a [working paper](https://www.blockchainresearchlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BRL-Working-Paper-No-18-DibiChain.pdf) sketching a privacy-preserving decentralized data exchange.

          Currently I am part of the [BloGÂ³ research project](https://www.blog3.de/) (link in German) which aims to give patients autonomy over their medical data.
          My contribution to the project includes co-architecting and co-implementing a decentralized data exchange built on top of the [Hyperledger Aries](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries) toolkit.
          Unfortunately, the results are not (yet) public.

        title: Data Engineering and Machine Learning
        description: |
          I have experience in various stages of the data processing life cycle, including automated data import from REST APIs,
          data modeling and transformation in TypeScript and Python,
          interaction with relational databases through ORMs and SQL
          as well as basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning.
          For a developer, my aversion to Microsoft Office is unusually low, and I enjoy explaining and presenting data to all kinds of audiences.
